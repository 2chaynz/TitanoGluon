My submission for the Titanic challenge on Kaggle, where I used two different ML models: AutoGluon and Random Forest.
The best result came from AutoGluon, achieving a score of 0.78947, ranking 1303rd out of 14,661 participants.
The commented scripts are accompanied by the corresponding outputs, CSV files, and a Typst document summarizing my notes and everything I learned during the challenge.
